# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## VSCode Docker Extension
Docker for VSCode makes it easy to use Docker

| Gitpod comes preinstalled with extension

## Containerizer Backend

### Run Python

```bash
cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```
- make sure port 4567 is open/unlocked via Gitpod **PORTS** tab
- click on url in **PORTS** tab
- and append /api/activities/home to url
- should see json object in browser

![HINT input url for json response]()

### Add Dockerfile

Create a file here: `backend-flask/Dockerfile`
Input the following into file:

```sh
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```

#### Build Container

* stop Flask server with Ctrl + c
* execute the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
unset FRONTEND_URL
unset BACKEND_URL
cd ..
docker build -t backend-flask:1.0 ./backend-flask
```

execute `docker image ls` to confirm that image was created

### Run Container

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask:1.0
```
* ensure port 4567 is unlocked in **PORTS** tab in Gitpod
* navigate to url displayed in **PORTS**
* should see **404 Not Found** page and the server running in terminal should confirm this by displaying the same error code
* stop container and run again with env
* execute `docker ps` to view running containers with ID
* execute `docker logs <container id>` to views logs running container
* **OR** in Docker extension right-click on running container and click on `Attach Shell` to execute commands within the container
* within container execute `env | grep _URL` to verify syntax of above was incorrect and did not pass env to container
* `docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -e FRONTEND_URL="*" -e BACKEND_URL="*" -it backend-flask:1.0`
* navigate to url in **PORTS** tab in Gitpod, append /api/activities/home to url and json object will be present
